Our Ninja X game is an action survival game, similar to survivor.io where the player controls a ninja (either by clicking WASD or arrow keys) who moves around the map and fights enemies (by pressing space) using directional slash attacks. Enemies chase the ninja and deal damage on contact, reducing the ninja’s health bar. The game starts on a start screen, ends when the ninja’s health reaches zero, and allows the player to restart or return to the start screen. Further features include gaining 1/4 amount of health every time the user clears a stage, along with a kill label, tracking how many kills the user has obtained. Once the user dies and clicks restart, an additional label will be added to track the Most kills the user got, and it will change depending on whether the user got more kills in a later game.
